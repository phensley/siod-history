.SH SYNOPSIS
.B siod
[-hXXXXX] [-iXXXXX] [-gX] [-oXXXXX] [-nXXXX] [-eXXXX]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Siod
is a very small scheme interpreter which can be used for calculations
or included as a command interpreter or extension/macro language in other
applications. See the documentation for interfacing requirements and how to
add user-defined data types.

.SS COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI \-h "XXXXX"
The
.I XXXXX
should be an integer, specifying the number of cons cells to
allocate in the heap. The default is 5000. Or an integer followed by
a colon, the number after which gives the maximum number of heaps to
malloc with mark and sweep gc mode.
.TP
.BI \-i "XXXXX"
The
.I XXXXX
should be the name of an init file to load before going into
the read/eval/print loop.
.TP
.BI \-g "X"
The
.I X
is 1 for a stop and copy garbage collector, 0 for a mark
and sweep one (the default).
.TP
.BI \-o "XXXXX"
The
.I XXXXX
should be an integer, specifying the size of the obarray (symbol hash table)
to use. Defaults to 100. Each array element is a list of symbols.
.TP
.BI \-n "XXXXX"
The
.I XXXXX
should be an integer, specifying the number of pre-cons numbers
to create. The default is 100.
.TP
.BI \-s "XXXXX"
The
.I XXXXX
should be an integer, specifying the number of bytes of recursion
on the machine (C-call frame) stack to allow. This may be changed
while the programming is running, and is mainly a convenience for
detecting defects in programs.
.TP
.BI \-e "XXXXX"
The
.I XXXXX
is an expression to evaluate (after loading the init file, if any).
After evaluating the expression the program will exit.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages may also set the variable errobj to the offending object.
.SH BUGS
With -g1 it does not GC during EVAL, only before each READ/EVAL/PRINT cycle.
It does GC during EVAL with -g0, but that code may not run without modification
on all architectures.
