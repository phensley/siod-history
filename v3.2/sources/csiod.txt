NAME
  csiod - a compiler/linker for siod

SYNOPSIS
  csiod [:o=outfile] [:m=flag] [:v=flag] [:i=val] infile

DESCRIPTION
  csiod Creates the output-filename, default a.out, by loading all the
  expressions from the input files, and then saving the result in fast-
  loading format. A "#! interpreter-name" style header is written to the out-
  put file using information from the optional flag arguments.


  COMMAND LINE OPTIONS


  :m=flag The flag defaults to 2, causing the procedure main to be invoked.
          Use a value of 3 for cgi scripts.

  :v=flag The flag defaults to "01" causing errors to be reported. A value of
          "0" supresses error messages, higher values cause more messages.
          Use a value of "1" or "0" for cgi scripts.

  :i=val  The val defaults to /usr/local/bin/siod
