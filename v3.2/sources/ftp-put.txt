NAME
  ftp-put - copy files from local host to remote using passive mode ftp

SYNOPSIS
  ftp-put LocalFilename RemoteHost [RemoteFilename] [:debug=true]
  [:buff=2048]

DESCRIPTION
  ftp-put Opens a connection to the ftp server on the RemoteHost, and puts
  the LocalFilename to a temporary filename constructed from the
  RemoteFilename.  When the data transfer is complete a RENAME operation is
  issued. Therefore the RemoteFilename appears atomically. This is very
  important when uploading files to an area from which other ftp and http
  processes are actively serving.


EXIT STATUS

  Errors result in a non-zero exit status.
