This is version 2.7 of Siod, Scheme In One Defun.

It is a very small implementation of the Scheme programming language.

George Carrette, MARCH 20, 1992. gjc@mitech.com, gjc@paradigm.com.

See siod.doc and the source file slib.c for more information.

The files slib.c and sliba.c may serve as a subroutine library to add
scheme interpreter functionality to any existing program.

Even though this is small, with an executable size of
38kbytes on VAX/VMS, 50kbytes on Mac, for example, 
the implementation supports some advanced features such
as arrays, hash tables, and fast/binary data saving and restoring.
